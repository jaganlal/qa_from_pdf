Check your policy or plan document to see when the deductible \\nstarts over (usually, but not always, January 1st). See the chart starting on page 2 for how \\nmuch you pay for covered services after you meet the deductible. \\n\\nAre there other \\ndeductibles for specific \\nservices? \\n\\nYes. $300 for prescription drug \\ncoverage.  There are no other \\nspecific deductibles. \\n\\nIs there an out–of–\\npocket limit on my \\nexpenses? \\n\\nYes. For participating providers \\n$2,500 person / $5,000 \\nfamily \\nFor non-participating providers \\n$4,000 person / $8,000 family \\n\\nWhat is not included in \\nthe out–of–pocket \\nlimit? \\n\\nPremiums, balance-billed \\ncharges, and health care this \\nplan doesn’t cover. \\n\\nIs there an overall \\nannual limit on what \\nthe plan pays? \\n\\nNo.  \\n\\nDoes this plan use a \\nnetwork of providers? \\n\\nYes. See www.[insert].com or \\ncall 1-800-[insert] for a list of \\nparticipating providers. \\n\\nYou must pay all of the costs for these services up to the specific deductible amount \\nbefore this plan begins to pay for these services. \\n\\nThe out-of-pocket limit is the most you could pay during a coverage period (usually one \\nyear) for your share of the cost of covered services. This limit helps you plan for health \\ncare expenses. \\n\\nEven though you pay these expenses, they don’t count toward the out-of-pocket limit.  \\n\\nThe chart starting on page 2 describes any limits on what the plan will pay for specific \\ncovered services, such as office visits. \\n\\nIf you use an in-network doctor or other health care provider, this plan will pay some or all \\nof the costs of covered services. Be aware, your in-network doctor or hospital may use an \\nout-of-network provider for some services.  Plans use the term in-network, preferred, or \\nparticipating for providers in their network.  See the chart starting on page 2 for how this \\nplan pays different kinds of providers.  \\n\\nDo I need a referral to \\nsee a specialist? \\n\\nNo. You don’t need a referral to \\nsee a specialist. \\n\\nYou can see the specialist you choose without permission from this plan. \\n\\nAre there services this \\nplan doesn’t cover? \\n\\nYes. \\n\\nSome of the services this plan doesn’t cover are listed on page 4. See your policy or plan \\ndocument for additional information about excluded services. \\n\\nQuestions: Call 1-800-[insert] or visit us at www.[insert]. \\nIf you aren’t clear about any of the underlined terms used in this form, see the Glossary.

For example, if \\nthe plan’s allowed amount for an overnight hospital stay is $1,000, your coinsurance payment of 20% would be $200.  This may change if \\nyou haven’t met your deductible.  \\n\\n  The amount the plan pays for covered services is based on the allowed amount. If an out-of-network provider charges more than the \\n\\nallowed amount, you may have to pay the difference. For example, if an out-of-network hospital charges $1,500 for an overnight stay and \\nthe allowed amount is $1,000, you may have to pay the $500 difference. (This is called balance billing.) \\n\\n  This plan may encourage you to use participating providers by charging you lower deductibles, copayments and coinsurance amounts. \\n\\nCommon  \\nMedical Event \\n\\nIf you visit a health \\ncare provider’s office \\nor clinic \\n\\nIf you have a test \\n\\nServices You May Need \\n\\nNon-\\n\\nLimitations & Exceptions \\n\\nYour Cost If \\nYou Use a  \\nParticipating \\n\\nProvider \\n\\nYour Cost If \\nYou Use a  \\n\\nParticipating \\n\\nProvider \\n\\n20% coinsurance \\nfor chiropractor \\nand acupuncture \\nNo charge \\n\\n 40% coinsurance \\nfor chiropractor \\nand acupuncture \\n 40% coinsurance \\n\\nPrimary care visit to treat an injury or illness \\n\\n$35 copay/visit \\n\\n 40% coinsurance \\n\\n–––––––––––none––––––––––– \\n\\nSpecialist visit \\n\\n$50 copay/visit \\n\\n 40% coinsurance \\n\\n–––––––––––none––––––––––– \\n\\nOther practitioner office visit \\n\\n–––––––––––none––––––––––– \\n\\nPreventive care/screening/immunization \\n\\nDiagnostic test (x-ray, blood work) \\n\\n $10 copay/test \\n\\n 40% coinsurance \\n\\n \\n–––––––––––none––––––––––– \\n\\nImaging (CT/PET scans, MRIs)  \\n\\n $50 copay/test \\n\\n 40% coinsurance \\n\\n–––––––––––none––––––––––– \\n\\nQuestions: Call 1-800-[insert] or visit us at www.[insert]. \\nIf you aren’t clear about any of the underlined terms used in this form, see the Glossary.

Check your policy or plan document to see when the deductible \\nstarts over (usually, but not always, January 1st). See the chart starting on page 2 for how \\nmuch you pay for covered services after you meet the deductible. \\n\\nAre there other \\ndeductibles for specific \\nservices? \\n\\nYes. $300 for prescription drug \\ncoverage.  There are no other \\nspecific deductibles. \\n\\nIs there an out–of–\\npocket limit on my \\nexpenses? \\n\\nYes. For participating providers \\n$2,500 person / $5,000 \\nfamily \\nFor non-participating providers \\n$4,000 person / $8,000 family \\n\\nWhat is not included in \\nthe out–of–pocket \\nlimit? \\n\\nPremiums, balance-billed \\ncharges, and health care this \\nplan doesn’t cover. \\n\\nIs there an overall \\nannual limit on what \\nthe plan pays? \\n\\nNo.  \\n\\nDoes this plan use a \\nnetwork of providers? \\n\\nYes. See www.[insert].com or \\ncall 1-800-[insert] for a list of \\nparticipating providers. \\n\\nYou must pay all of the costs for these services up to the specific deductible amount \\nbefore this plan begins to pay for these services. \\n\\nThe out-of-pocket limit is the most you could pay during a coverage period (usually one \\nyear) for your share of the cost of covered services. This limit helps you plan for health \\ncare expenses. \\n\\nEven though you pay these expenses, they don’t count toward the out-of-pocket limit.  \\n\\nThe chart starting on page 2 describes any limits on what the plan will pay for specific \\ncovered services, such as office visits. \\n\\nIf you use an in-network doctor or other health care provider, this plan will pay some or all \\nof the costs of covered services. Be aware, your in-network doctor or hospital may use an \\nout-of-network provider for some services.  Plans use the term in-network, preferred, or \\nparticipating for providers in their network.  See the chart starting on page 2 for how this \\nplan pays different kinds of providers.  \\n\\nDo I need a referral to \\nsee a specialist? \\n\\nNo. You don’t need a referral to \\nsee a specialist. \\n\\nYou can see the specialist you choose without permission from this plan. \\n\\nAre there services this \\nplan doesn’t cover? \\n\\nYes. \\n\\nSome of the services this plan doesn’t cover are listed on page 4.

For example, if \\nthe plan’s allowed amount for an overnight hospital stay is $1,000, your coinsurance payment of 20% would be $200.  This may change if \\nyou haven’t met your deductible.  \\n\\n  The amount the plan pays for covered services is based on the allowed amount. If an out-of-network provider charges more than the \\n\\nallowed amount, you may have to pay the difference. For example, if an out-of-network hospital charges $1,500 for an overnight stay and \\nthe allowed amount is $1,000, you may have to pay the $500 difference. (This is called balance billing.) \\n\\n  This plan may encourage you to use participating providers by charging you lower deductibles, copayments and coinsurance amounts. \\n\\nCommon  \\nMedical Event \\n\\nIf you visit a health \\ncare provider’s office \\nor clinic \\n\\nIf you have a test \\n\\nServices You May Need \\n\\nNon-\\n\\nLimitations & Exceptions \\n\\nYour Cost If \\nYou Use a  \\nParticipating \\n\\nProvider \\n\\nYour Cost If \\nYou Use a  \\n\\nParticipating \\n\\nProvider \\n\\n20% coinsurance \\nfor chiropractor \\nand acupuncture \\nNo charge \\n\\n 40% coinsurance \\nfor chiropractor \\nand acupuncture \\n 40% coinsurance \\n\\nPrimary care visit to treat an injury or illness \\n\\n$35 copay/visit \\n\\n 40% coinsurance \\n\\n–––––––––––none––––––––––– \\n\\nSpecialist visit \\n\\n$50 copay/visit \\n\\n 40% coinsurance \\n\\n–––––––––––none––––––––––– \\n\\nOther practitioner office visit \\n\\n–––––––––––none––––––––––– \\n\\nPreventive care/screening/immunization \\n\\nDiagnostic test (x-ray, blood work) \\n\\n $10 copay/test \\n\\n 40% coinsurance \\n\\n \\n–––––––––––none––––––––––– \\n\\nImaging (CT/PET scans, MRIs)  \\n\\n $50 copay/test \\n\\n 40% coinsurance \\n\\n–––––––––––none––––––––––– \\n\\nQuestions: Call 1-800-[insert] or visit us at www.[insert]. \\nIf you aren’t clear about any of the underlined terms used in this form, see the Glossary.
